# Project Setup Instructions

To get started, you need to add your API key to the `.env` file.

1. Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project if it doesn't already exist.
2. Add the following line to the `.env` file: API_KEY=your_api_key_here
3. Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual API key that you obtained from the API provider.

This will allow the project to access the necessary API for functioning.
